## Overview

This test checks whether the app writes sensitive data unencrypted to storage locations in the app sandbox that are configured for sharing by enabling file sharing in the app's Info.plist using the `UIFileSharingEnabled` ("Application supports iTunes file sharing") and `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` ("Supports opening documents in place") keys set to `YES`.

## Steps

1. Run a static analysis tool such as @MASTG-TOOL-0073 on the app binary.

2. Search for APIs that indicate use of shared storage, for example:

      - [`documentDirectory`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager/searchpathdirectory/documentdirectory) (commonly exposed via iTunes File Sharing / Files app)
      - `FileManager.default.urls(for:in:)` with `documentDirectory`
      - Direct path manipulation under `.../Documents` for write operations (`Data.write(to:)`, `String.write(to:)`, `NSFileHandle`, `NSOutputStream`)

3. Check the app's `Info.plist` (@MASTG-TECH-0058) for the `UIFileSharingEnabled` and `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace` flags.

## Observation

The output should contain:

- A list of code locations that write (or could write) to shared storage.
- The state of `UIFileSharingEnabled` and `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace`.

## Evaluation

The test fails if:

- The app writes unencrypted sensitive data to `documentDirectory` (or equivalent shared storage path), and
- `Info.plist` enables user access to the Documents directory (`UIFileSharingEnabled` and/or `LSSupportsOpeningDocumentsInPlace`).

Note: `documentDirectory` by itself is not inherently insecure; the risk arises when sensitive data is stored there and exposed via file sharing or Files app access. In contrast, data stored in other locations within the app sandbox (e.g., `Library/Application Support`) with encryption, or in the Keychain cannot be accessed even if file sharing is enabled.
