## Overview

iOS apps commonly use various object persistence mechanisms to store and retrieve data. These include `NSCoding`/`NSSecureCoding`, `Codable`, JSON encoding, property lists, XML parsing, and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks like Core Data and Realm (see @MASTG-KNOW-0075 for details).

Insecure object persistence can lead to:

- **Exposure of sensitive data**: If serialized data is not encrypted, attackers with access to the device or backups can read sensitive information.
- **Data tampering**: Without integrity verification (such as HMAC or digital signatures), attackers can modify serialized data to bypass security controls or inject malicious payloads.
- **Insecure deserialization attacks**: If the app does not properly validate deserialized data before use, attackers can exploit this to execute arbitrary code, bypass authentication, or manipulate business logic.

When using object persistence, developers should:

- Use `NSSecureCoding` instead of `NSCoding` to ensure type safety during deserialization.
- Encrypt sensitive data before persistence and verify its integrity before use.
- Store encryption keys securely in the Keychain with appropriate protection attributes.
- Validate all deserialized data before use.

## Steps

1. Identify object persistence mechanisms used by the app using @MASTG-TECH-0058 and look for uses of serialization APIs such as `NSCoding`, `NSSecureCoding`, `Codable`, `JSONEncoder`/`JSONDecoder`, `PropertyListEncoder`/`PropertyListDecoder`, `NSKeyedArchiver`/`NSKeyedUnarchiver`, Core Data, or Realm.
2. Determine if sensitive data is being serialized by analyzing the data types being persisted.
3. For dynamic analysis, use @MASTG-TECH-0095 to hook serialization and deserialization methods and observe the data being processed.

## Observation

The output should include a list of:

- Serialization APIs being used by the app.
- Data types being serialized, including whether they contain sensitive information.
- Whether `NSSecureCoding` is used instead of `NSCoding`.
- Whether encryption and integrity verification are applied to serialized data.

## Evaluation

Data should be considered untrusted when it originates from sources outside the app's direct control, including network responses, user input, data from other apps via IPC, files from shared storage, or data restored from backups.

The test case fails if any of the following conditions are met:

- Sensitive data is serialized without encryption.
- The app uses `NSCoding` instead of `NSSecureCoding` for deserializing untrusted data.
- Serialized data lacks integrity verification (HMAC or signatures) when integrity is required.
- The app does not validate deserialized data before using it in security-relevant operations.
